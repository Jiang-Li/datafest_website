<div class="faq-content">
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>If I don't have a team, can I participate in the DataFest individually?</strong>
This is a team challenge. We encourage students to form their own team for the best experience. However, if you don't have a team, please still register for the event using this link, and indicate that you need a team. We will place you on a team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What statistical software is used in DataFest?</strong>
No specific software is required. Students are free to use the analytics software of their choice or comfort level. Excel, R, Python, SAS, Jamovi, SPSS are just some of the tools that can be used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I don't know programming/coding. Can I still participate?</strong>
Yes! Even if you are not experienced with coding, someone else on your team might have that skill set. You can bring other strengths to your team such as problem-solving skills, communication, statistics knowledge, etc. Besides, there are analytics tools that don't require any coding and you are welcome to use them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Who is providing the data set?</strong>
A sponsoring organization will provide the data set and a brief explanation of the challenge just before the event starts. Because ASA partners with different organizations each year, the data could come from a variety of fields such as healthcare, education, police data, internet searches, or business trends. The sponsoring organization will remain a &quot;secret&quot; until the beginning of the DataFest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can I share my analysis with my employer or professors?</strong>
No, the data set may not be shared with anyone else to maintain data privacy. However, your final presentation/video can be shared with others without revealing the original data set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How will mentors help the teams?</strong>
Mentors are industry professionals, faculty members, or graduate students. They will initially meet with each team to help them understand the data set, help them brainstorm ideas, and give them some guidance. They will NOT do any coding or analysis work for you. They are not expected to answer any tool-specific questions as the team's choice of analytics tool may not be something the mentor is experienced with. Mentors ARE there to guide you towards your team's goal with their industry/business wisdom. They can be reached during the DataFest weekend for further questions/guidance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Does everyone in the team have to be in the final presentation?</strong>
Not at all. The teams can decide who will present the analysis. It could be just one person or multiple team-mates. The names of all team members must be listed on the cover page of the presentation.</p>
