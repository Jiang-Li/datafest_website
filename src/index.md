# DataFest 2025


The American Statistical Association (ASA) DataFest is a celebration of data in which teams of two to five students work around the clock to analyze a real-world data set over the course of one weekend.

Teams will be guided by roving mentors who are graduate students, faculty, and industry professionals. Many professionals find ASA DataFest to be a great recruiting opportunity–they get to watch and support talented undergraduate students work under pressure in a team and examine their thinking processes.

Franklin University is excited to host a virtual DataFest between **April 18th – April 20th** in 2025. ASA will provide a surprise data set which is revealed to participants at a kick-off event on Friday April 18 at 5pm and teams will work throughout the weekend to analyze the data and derive insights. Students can use analytics tools of their choice, including but not limited to Microsoft Excel, Power BI, Tableau, R, Python, or others.

After two days of intense data wrangling, analysis, and presentation design, each team is allowed a few minutes and no more than two slides (plus a cover slide) to impress a panel of judges on Sunday April 21. Prizes are given in the category of **Best Insight**.
