    <h2>About ASA DataFest</h2>
    <p>The American Statistical Association (ASA) DataFest is a celebration of data in which teams of two to five students work around the clock to analyze a real-world data set over the course of one weekend.</p>
    
    <p>Teams will be guided by roving mentors who are graduate students, faculty, and industry professionals. Many professionals find ASA DataFest to be a great recruiting opportunity–they get to watch and support talented undergraduate students work under pressure in a team and examine their thinking processes.</p>
