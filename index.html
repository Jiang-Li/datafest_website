          <p><span >The American Statistical Association (ASA) DataFest is a 
            celebration of data in which teams of two to five students work 
            around the clock to analyze a real-world data set over the 
            course of one weekend. </span></p>

          <p><span >Teams will be guided by roving mentors who are graduate 
            students, faculty, and industry professionals. Many professionals 
            find ASA DataFest to be a great recruiting opportunity–they get to 
            watch and support talented undergraduate students work under 
            pressure in a team and examine their thinking processes.</span></p>

          <p><span >Franklin University is excited to host a virtual DataFest 
            between <b>April 19th – April 21th</b> in 2024. ASA will provide 
            a surprise data set which is revealed to participants at a kick-off 
            event on Friday April 19 at 5pm and teams will work throughout 
            the weekend to analyze the data and derive insights. Students 
            can use analytics tools of their choice, including but not limited 
            to Microsoft Excel,  
            Tableau, R, Python, or others.</span></p>

          <p><span >After two days of intense data wrangling, analysis, 
            and presentation design, each team is allowed a few minutes 
            and no more than two slides (plus a cover slide) to impress 
            a panel of judges on Sunday April 21. Prizes are given in 
            the category of <b>Best Insight</b>.</span></p>

            <b>FAQ:</b><br>
          </span></p>

          <p><span >
              1. If I don’t have a team, can I participate in the DataFest individually?
              <br/>
              This is a team challenge. We encourage students to form their own team for
              the best experience. However, if you don’t have a team, please still
              register for the event using this link, and indicate that you need a team.
              We will place you on a team.
          </span></p>
          <p><span >
              2. What statistical software is used in DataFest?
              <br/>
              No specific software is required. Students are free to use the analytics
              software of their choice or comfort level. Excel, R, Python, SAS, Jamovi,
              SPSS are just some of the tools that can be used.
          </span></p>
          <p><span >
              3. I don’t know programming/coding. Can I still participate?
              <br/>
              Yes! Even if you are not experienced with coding, someone else on your team
              might have that skill set. You can bring other strengths to your team such
              as problem-solving skills, communication, statistics knowledge, etc.
              Besides, there are analytics tools that don’t require any coding and you
              are welcome to use them.
          </span></p>
          <p><span >
              4. Who is providing the data set?
              <br/>
              A sponsoring organization will provide the data set and a brief explanation
              of the challenge just before the event starts. Because ASA partners with
              different organizations each year, the data could come from a variety of
              fields such as healthcare, education, police data, internet searches, or
              business trends. The sponsoring organization will remain a “secret” until
              the beginning of the DataFest.
          </span></p>
          <p><span >
              5. Can I share my analysis with my employer or professors?
              <br/>
              No, the data set may not be shared with anyone else to maintain data
              privacy. However, your final presentation/video can be shared with others
              without revealing the original data set.
          </span></p>
          <p><span >
              6. How will mentors help the teams?
              <br/>
              Mentors are industry professionals, faculty members, or graduate students.
              They will initially meet with each team to help them understand the data
              set, help them brainstorm ideas, and give them some guidance. They will NOT
              do any coding or analysis work for you. They are not expected to answer any
              tool-specific questions as the team’s choice of analytics tool may not be
              something the mentor is experienced with. Mentors ARE there to guide you
              towards your team’s goal with their industry/business wisdom. They can be
              reached during the DataFest weekend for further questions/guidance.
          </span></p>
          <p><span >
              7. Does everyone in the team have to be in the final presentation?
              </br>
              Not at all. The teams can decide who will present the analysis. It could be
              just one person or multiple team-mates. The names of all team members must
              be listed on the cover page of the presentation.
